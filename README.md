# Jobhunt Emails Classifier

This project focuses on the development of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based email classifier designed to support job seekers in managing recruitment-related communication. Using Scikit-learn pipelines, the system automatically categorizes incoming emails into key classes such as Invitation, Rejection, Confirmation, or Other. The solution demonstrates the use of machine learning, TF-IDF vectorization, and multiple model architectures (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and a Two-Stage Pipeline). It highlights both the practical application of NLP techniques and the implementation of clean, modular Python code for a real-world use case.
